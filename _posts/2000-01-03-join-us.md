Everyone is welcome!

Please note that WeAllJS strives to be a **supportive community** and expects an appropriate level of respect and mutual understanding. We have a strong [Code of Conduct](#todo) and [enforcement policy](#todo). tl;dr: We do not welcome discrimination, harassment, or any other form of harm against our members, and we prioritize the well-being of those who are hurt over the comfort of those who caused harm.

If you're cool with all that? We'd love to have you! Filling out this form will submit a signup request to the WeAllJS Slack. You should receive an email shortly after.
