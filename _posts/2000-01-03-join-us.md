# Join the Slack!

Everyone is welcome!

Please note that WeAllJS strives to be a *supportive* community and expects an appropriate level of respect and mutual understanding. We have a strong [Code of Conduct](#todo) and [enforcement policy](#todo). tl;dr: We do not welcome discrimination, harassment, or any other form of harm against our members, and we prioritize the well-being of those who are hurt over the comfort of those who caused harm.

If you're cool with all that? We'd love to have you!
