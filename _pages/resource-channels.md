# Resource Channels Directory

Channels are listed by overall topic. If the channel has a docent, the docent or docents' name(s) will be listed next to the channel name.

Resource channels can only be created by admins, and are restricted to a couple of categories. See the Culture and Process for more details.

Admins should keep this list updated as channels are created/renamed/removed.
